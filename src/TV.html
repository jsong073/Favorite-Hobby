    <h1>TV Shows</h1>
    <p>I spend a lot of my time on Netflix. Here are some of my favorite shows.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Parks and Recreation</h3> <br/>
            <img src="img/ParksAndRec.jpg" alt="parks-and-rec-photo" class="video-game-image"/> <br/>
            Probably my favorite sitcom. A gang of government agents trying to improve the parks in their town. I like
            it because it's funny, but everyone in the show is still mostly nice to each other.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h3>
            <img src="img/ATLACover.jpg" alt="atla-cover" class="video-game-image"/> <br/>
            One of my favorite shows of all time. A boy hidden in an iceberg for over 100 years must learn to control
            all four elements and defeat a tyrannical king. Great for both adults and kids.
